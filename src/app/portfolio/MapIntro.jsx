          This page includes five mapping projects completed in GEO 678: Spatial
          Storytelling. Each map is a different perspective on water access and
          related water issues in India. These maps are extensions of my
          research on water access in India as an issue of human rights,
          development, and political discourse. As you move through each map,
          you may note the political and economic perspectives which foregrounds
          each map, but I encourage viewers to hold this focus in constant
          tension with the fact that water is a necessary part of human, plant,
          and animal existence. This page begins with preliminary two
          preliminary sketch maps before it moves into my reflexivity statement,
          and finally on to each map.
