            This page includes five mapping projects completed in GEO 678:
            Spatial Storytelling. Each map is a different perspective on water
            access and related water issues in India. These maps are extensions
            of my research on water access in India as an issue of human rights,
            development, and political discourse. As you move through each map,
            you may note the political and economic perspectives which
            foregrounds each map, but I encourage viewers to hold this focus in
            constant tension with the fact that water is a necessary part of
            human, plant, and animal existence. This page begins with
            preliminary two preliminary sketch maps before it moves into my
            reflexivity statement, and finally on to each map.
