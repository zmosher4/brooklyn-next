        As an academic researcher born and raised in the United States it is
        critical to reflect on my position in my research related to water
        access in India. An important element is my position as a white woman
        from a middle-class background who has had the opportunity to attend
        higher education and am working in a space of immense privilege that so
        often reproduces and upholds structures of power. Specifically, this
        central element of reflection as I conduct research in India speaking
        with community members and locals who are often marginalized and
        disenfranchised within the context of India. As a Caucasian academic
        from the U.S., I am inherently entering a power dynamic every time I
        engage in community-based research. This is especially true given
        Indiaâ€™s former colonization by Britain left lasting impacts on social
        structures and power hierarchies that often position me in a place of
        power over the communities I interact with. As a woman, this is slightly
        improved in the context of gender relations but creates its own
        complexities that I must be mindful including speaking with young men,
        women in highly traditional family structures, and speaking with
        government officials. One way in which I engage with both of these
        elements in an attempt to diffuse the power structures embedded in
        interactions is to begin by allowing participants to ask questions of me
        and my research. This enables an initial flow of information that the
        participant can control. In addition to this, I always make it clear at
        the start, throughout my qualitative data collection process, and at the
        end that any participant is welcome to withdraw portions or all of their
        statements from my research project at any time regardless of where I am
        in the process of research or publication. I also intend to share back
        my findings with participants prior to publication to give them an
        opportunity to make suggestions, indicate where I may have
        misrepresented them, and another option for withdrawing their
        statements.{' '}

          Another realm of positionality is related to my work with development
          organizations and professionals. While in attendance at development
          organization meetings or interviewing professionals I enter into
          another space of inequal power dynamics, but one where power and
          positionality are much more diffuse and obscured. In these spaces I am
          often seen as an equal given my status as an academic, but I am also
          occasionally automatically placed in a position below from which I
          need to be mindful of how I navigate the power dynamic which places me
          at a slight disadvantage in data collection. More importantly, these
          spaces create power dynamics even without individuals or communities
          involved. I often must navigate and be mindful of instances where
          attempts are made to diminish or marginalize experiences of the
          communities in India with which I work. In these moments, my power as
          a researcher also becomes evident and it is critical even in moments
          when I do not have the ability to combat these narratives, that I
          reflect on them and include them in my analysis to ensure I am
          considering my own and participant biases in my research.
          Understanding, reflecting on, and embedding practices of questioning
          my own positionality and power in spaces of my research is a crucial
          part of my work and requires on going and diligent practice.
